<h1>Practicing with Python Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As a security analyst, I may often use notebook environments and notebooks to write and run code.This lab will help me get familiar with working in a notebook environment, writing code comments
in Python, and displaying strings with the print() function.In this lab, I'll complete a series of tasks that involve observing and running some pre-written cells of text and code, as well as filling in cells with my own text, Python code, and code comments.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Python Notebook</b>

Display message: For this task, use print() to display the message "I am a security analyst." by placing that message within the parentheses. Be sure to replace the ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own
code before running the following code cell. <br/>

Display all messages: For your final task, you’ll combine all the print() statements you’ve encountered and written in this lab up to this point, into one code cell. Complete the following code with the remaining messages. Be sure to replace each ### YOUR CODE HERE ### with your own code before running the following cell.  <br/>
